# Assignment1-Group11
HKUST-SOSC4300-5500 Assignment 1

Zhou Jie Li and I, Rachel Loh have grouped together to complete this assignment. We have written python (Jie Li) and R codes (Rachel) respectively to try different  algorithms to get the best prediction. Jie Li used seven python algorithms to complete this assignment: Gradient Tree Boosting, Decision Tree, XGBoost,Random Forest, SVM,Light GBM, Naive Bayes. I used 6 R packages, namely, Classification Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Modeling, Caret, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. The algorithm that had the best prediction was XGBoost python algorithm with the default parameters even after adjusting the relevant parameters. 

## Python 
Read ```zjl-python-Code interpretation).ipynb``` file **first** for an overall code interpretation.

The rest of the code files can also run independently. Each code file uses a different python algorithms and some are repeated but with adjusted parameters. 

See ```zjl-python- XGBoost-(Adjust the parameters).ipynb``` for the code with best prediction.

## R
All of the codes files can run independently.
