HKUST-SOSC4300-5500 Assignment 1

Zhou Jie Li and I, Rachel Loh have grouped together to complete this assignment. We have written python (Jie Li) and R codes (Rachel) respectively to try different  algorithms to get the best prediction. Jie Li used seven python algorithms to complete this assignment: Gradient Tree Boosting, Decision Tree, XGBoost,Random Forest, SVM,Light GBM, Naive Bayes. I used 6 R packages, namely, Classification Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Modeling, Regularized Cox Regression, GLM and The Relax Lasso. The algorithm that had the best prediction was XGBoost with the default parameters even after adjusting the relevant parameters.
